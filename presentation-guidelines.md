### **PowerPoint Outline**

#### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
- Project Title: **"Social Networking Application with Cloud and DevOps Integration"**.
- Team Members’ Names.
- Date and Institution/Program Name.

#### **Slide 2: Outline**
- Briefly list the sections of the presentation:
  - Problem Statement
  - Solution Overview
  - Tech Stack
  - Implementation
  - Challenges
  - Future Enhancements

#### **Slide 3: Problem Statement**
- The initial goal of the application (e.g., a scalable and reliable social networking app).
- Challenges with traditional development:
  - Manual deployments.
  - Lack of scalability.
  - No automated pipelines.

#### **Slide 4: Solution Overview**
- Introduce the DevOps and cloud-based solution:
  - Migrated to **AWS (EC2, RDS)**.
  - Implemented **Docker** for containerization.
  - Automated deployments with **Jenkins**.

#### **Slide 5: Tech Stack**
- Backend: **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **SQL**.
- Frontend: **React**, **CSS**.
- Tools: **AWS EC2**, **RDS**, **Docker**, **Jenkins**, **Git**.
- Database: **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL or MySQL)**.
- CI/CD: **Jenkins with Docker integration**.

#### **Slide 6: Architecture Diagram**
- Visual representation of the architecture:
  - Frontend (React) deployed as a container.
  - Backend (Spring Boot) containerized and running on **EC2**.
  - **RDS** for database storage.
  - Jenkins pipeline for CI/CD.

#### **Slide 7: Implementation**
- Key features implemented:
  - Containerization: Dockerized backend and frontend.
  - CI/CD pipeline: Automated testing, building, and deployment.
  - AWS deployment: Hosted on EC2 with RDS integration.
  - Health monitoring: Endpoint checks and basic logging.

#### **Slide 8: Live Demo**
- Show the deployed application:
  - Access via public URL (EC2 instance).
  - Demonstrate core functionality:
    - Login/Register.
    - Posting content.
    - Reacting and commenting.
    - Search and profile management.

#### **Slide 9: Challenges**
- Discuss obstacles faced:
  - Learning AWS and Docker.
  - Configuring Jenkins pipelines.
  - Managing database migrations on RDS.
  - Debugging deployment issues on EC2.

#### **Slide 10: Future Enhancements**
- Possible improvements:
  - Advanced monitoring (e.g., AWS CloudWatch or Prometheus).
  - Load balancing for scalability.
  - Use Kubernetes for container orchestration.
  - Adding a file upload feature with AWS S3.

#### **Slide 11: Conclusion**
- Summary of the project’s achievements.
- Lessons learned from integrating DevOps and cloud tools.

#### **Slide 12: Q&A**
- Invite questions and feedback from the audience.

### **Tips for the Presentation**
1. **Rehearse the Demo**:
   - Ensure the live demo runs smoothly. Test the public URL, application features, and response times.
   - Have a backup plan in case the demo doesn’t work (e.g., screenshots).

2. **Highlight the "Why"**:
   - Clearly explain why specific tools and practices (e.g., Docker, Jenkins) were chosen.
   - Emphasize the benefits (scalability, automation, reliability).

3. **Divide Roles**:
   - Assign different parts of the presentation to team members (e.g., one explains the architecture, another handles the demo).

4. **Engage the Audience**:
   - Use visuals like diagrams and screenshots to make concepts clear.
   - Avoid reading slides verbatim; instead, explain them conversationally.

5. **Anticipate Questions**:
   - Be prepared to discuss technical choices, challenges, and improvements.
