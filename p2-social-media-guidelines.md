### **Project 2 Guidelines: Social Networking Application with DevOps and Cloud Integration**

For Project 2, associates will extend the functionality of their Social Networking application by integrating **DevOps practices**, **Docker**, **AWS services**, and **Jenkins**. The goal is to deploy a fully functional, containerized application with CI/CD pipelines and cloud-hosted infrastructure.

---

### **Project Objectives**

1. **Implement Cloud Infrastructure**:
   - Host the application on AWS using EC2 and RDS.
   - Use IAM roles to manage access and permissions securely.

2. **Containerization**:
   - Dockerize the backend application. Front-end is optional.

3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Create a Jenkins pipeline to automate testing, building, and deploying the application.

4. **Scalability and Monitoring (Optional)**:
   - Implement auto-scaling using AWS features.
   - Set up monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch or similar tools.
